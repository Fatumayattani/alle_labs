# **Alle Labs**
### Truth intelligence for the AI era

Alle Labs is an AI powered truth engine that detects deepfakes, verifies media authenticity, and publishes verifiable Knowledge Assets to the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph. Built using the DKG Edge Node, MCP agents, and Polkadot x402 micropayments, Alle Labs creates an open trust layer that any AI agent can rely on to confirm what is real.

Alle Labs helps people and machines uncover truth in an internet full of synthetic media. It turns authenticity checks into permanent, queryable truth records that agents can reuse, cite, and trust.

## **✨ Key features**

### **Media authenticity verification**
Upload an image or video or provide a URL. Alle Labs runs a deepfake detection pipeline powered by lightweight pre trained models and analytic heuristics.

### **Truth assets on the DKG**
Every authenticity result is converted into a JSON LD Knowledge Asset with provenance including model version, timestamps, media hash, and scoring details.

### **MCP agent integration**
Alle Labs exposes MCP tools so any AI agent or IDE can request verification, fetch proof, or publish assessments through the DKG Agent interface.

### **x402 micropayments with Polkadot**
Basic checks are free. Premium accuracy checks and bulk queries are gated through x402 micropayments on Polkadot to create a sustainable trust economy.

### **Community Notes for media**
Authenticity assessments extend the Umanitek Guardian dataset with structured fact checks linked to content.

## **📚 How it works**

### 1
A user uploads media or provides a URL through the DKG Agent or any MCP client.

### 2
The Alle Labs MCP plugin receives the request and checks payment status if premium scanning is requested.

### 3
The plugin passes the media to a Python based detection worker that extracts frames, runs detection models, and returns a structured truth report.

### 4
The report is turned into a JSON LD Knowledge Asset aligned with the hackathon ontologies.

### 5
The Knowledge Asset is published to the DKG with provenance, making it permanently verifiable and retrievable by other agents.

### 6
The result is returned to the user along with the Knowledge Asset UAL for reference.
